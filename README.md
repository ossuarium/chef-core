## Recipes

* otr::default - Configures a minimal base system.
* [otr::deployment](#otrdeployment) - Sets up the deployer user and deployers group.
* [otr::lamp_app_server](#otrlamp_app_server) - Configures the Apache HTTP Server, MySQL client, PHP-FPM.
* [otr::mysql_server](#otrmysql_server) - Configures a MySQL server.

### otr::deployment

_This recipe should generally be placed near the end of the run list._

Users are added to the deployers groups using the [users cookbook]
with the group name `deployers`.

This installs nodejs and a set of default npm packages.

This installs rbenv for each deployer along with
a Ruby version and a set of default gems (including Bundler).

[users cookbook]: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/users


### otr::lamp_app_server

This installs the Apache HTTP Server, MySQL client, PHP-FPM,
and the necessary modules to host a PHP application using mod_fastcgi.

This also installs the [database cookbook].

[database cookbook]: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/database


### otr::mysql_server

This will configure a MySQL server and optionally
setup phpMyAdmin running on Nginx using FastCGI and PHP-FPM.


## Resources
